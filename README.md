# Privacy-Preserving Image Processing for Facial Recognition

## Project Overview
This project addresses the critical issue of privacy in facial recognition systems through the exploration and implementation of advanced privacy-preserving methods, such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. The aim is to minimize the risk of re-identification while ensuring robust system performance under diverse conditions.

## Objective
To develop a facial recognition system that not only performs efficiently under varying conditions but also rigorously protects the privacy of individuals' biometric data.

## Features
- **Data Privacy**: Implements differential privacy and homomorphic encryption to protect sensitive biometric data.
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Ensures the system is capable of performing in real-time with high accuracy across different lighting conditions, angles, and facial expressions.
- **Accessibility**: Designed to be compatible with conventional devices, making privacy-preserving technology more accessible.

## Methodologies
### Data Handling
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, ensuring a comprehensive range of facial features for robust training.
- **Encryption**: Employs homomorphic encryption to perform computations on encrypted data, maintaining the confidentiality of the data throughout the processing.

### Privacy Techniques
- **Differential Privacy**: Ensures that the inclusion or exclusion of an individualâ€™s data does not significantly affect the outcome of analyses.
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows for operations on encrypted data without the need to decrypt, preserving privacy throughout the computation process.

### Model Development
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Uses advanced neural networks, optimized for facial recognition, to ensure high performance and accuracy.
- **Secure Processing**: Integrates secure multiparty computation techniques to protect both biometric data and the results from unauthorized access.

## Results
- The project successfully demonstrated the application of privacy-preserving techniques in a real-time facial recognition system.
- Rigorous evaluation using standard benchmarks confirmed the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system under various conditions.

## Discussion
- The study highlighted the importance of privacy in biometric technologies and demonstrated effective strategies to safeguard sensitive data.
- It also emphasized the balance between system performance and privacy, suggesting areas for further research and improvement.
